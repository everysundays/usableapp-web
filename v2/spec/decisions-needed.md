## High Priority (Must Decide Before Development Starts)

### 1. Hero Statement ⭐ CRITICAL
**Updated**: 18 variations created based on your input (see content-strategy.md)

**Top Recommendations**:
1. **"Good problems make good apps."** - Simple, memorable, provocative
2. **"Refine the problem. Define the solution."** - Clear process, professional
3. **"Turn the right problem into the right solution."** - Transformative, confident

**Other Strong Options**:
- "Find good problems. Make good apps."
- "Innovation starts with the right problem."
- "Ask better. Build better."

**Reference**: "Behind Technology There's Human" (competitor - philosophical level you admire)

**Action**: Select ONE final statement or provide direction for refinement


#### selected
- "Find good problems. Make good apps." -- winner 1
- "Refine the problem. Define the solution." -- winner 2 could be used with "how it works" section

2. **Human × Unconventional × Problem Solver** - White, deep purple, electric lime (bold)
3. **Digital × Human × Understanding** - Cool gray, navy, terracotta, cyan
4. **Ease of Use × Human × Problem Solver** - Off-white, forest green, soft gold, sand

**Recommended**: **Concept 1** or **Concept 3** (balance warmth with professionalism)

### 3. Tech Stack 🛠️ DECIDED

### 8. Video Background in Hero
**Your note**: "if it goes well with the project then it's okay. we can even tint the color. but for now let's do something plain"
