challenge: "Tourists visiting Bangkok's cultural sites struggled with navigation, missed important landmarks, and lacked context about the historical significance of locations. Traditional tour guides were expensive and inflexible."

The app provides turn-by-turn navigation, tells stories about history and culture at each location, and allows users to explore at their own pace. Features include route planning, points of interest, and multilingual content."
results:
  - "Featured in Thai Health Promotion Foundation partnership"
  - "Covers multiple heritage areas including Samphanthawong and Na Kluea"
  - "Integrated with local festivals and community events"
  - "Easy planning with rest stops and restaurant recommendations"
