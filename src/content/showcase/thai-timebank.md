order: 2
challenge: "Modern urban communities face isolation despite physical proximity. People need help with daily tasks but hesitate to ask neighbors due to social barriers. Traditional volunteer systems lack reciprocity, making sustainable community support difficult. Elderly residents who can't contribute physically feel excluded from community networks."
solution: "We designed Thai Time Bank as a mobile platform that transforms time into currency for community exchange. The system uses 'time credits' (1 hour = 60 credits) to facilitate neighbor-to-neighbor help. Key innovations include family credit pooling for elderly care, progressive radius matching (5km → 10km → 15km) for urgent requests, and a 'neighbor endorsement chain' where members can amplify requests they can't fulfill themselves. The platform mimics real-world neighbor interactions with staged information disclosure and grace periods for commitment."
results:
  - "Launched with 1,000+ quality members focused on mutual aid mindset"
  - "Family credit system enables elderly participation without physical contribution"
  - "Priority escalation ensures no request goes unanswered"
  - "Community manager oversight for high-priority and disputed cases"
  - "Built-in trust system through verified identities and review ratings"
