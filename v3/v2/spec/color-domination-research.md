## New Strategy: Bold Color Blocking

### Principle: Section Identity Through Color

Each section gets a **dominant color personality**:

1. **Hero**: White/Clean (entry point)
2. **What We Do**: NAVY DARK (trust, process)
3. **How It Works**: WHITE + CYAN gradient (technical clarity)
4. **Showcase**: TERRACOTTA (human results)
5. **Pricing**: WHITE + NAVY dark cards (professional decision)
6. **Contact**: CYAN gradient (final action)

### Why This Works

**Memorability**:
- Users remember "the navy and terracotta company"
- Each section has distinct color personality
- Creates visual story as user scrolls

**Brand Domination**:
- Navy and terracotta appear LARGE
- Not hiding colors in small accents
- Bold, confident usage

**Visual Rhythm**:
- Light → Dark → Light → Warm → Light → Cool
- Creates natural flow and anticipation
- Prevents monotony

**Functionality**:
- Navy sections = trust, process, professional
- Terracotta sections = human, results, emotion
- Cyan sections = technical, action, clarity

## Implementation Rules

### Rule 1: One Dominant Color Per Section
- Not just background accent - THE BACKGROUND
- 60% of section should be the color
- Creates strong visual identity

### Rule 2: High Contrast Text
- White text on navy/terracotta
- Navy text on white/cyan
- Must pass WCAG AAA

### Rule 3: Accent Colors Support, Don't Compete
- If section is navy, accents are terracotta/cyan
- If section is terracotta, accents are white/cyan
- No color fighting for dominance

### Rule 4: Consistent Pattern
- Same colors mean same things site-wide
- Navy = professional/process
- Terracotta = human/results
- Cyan = technical/clarity
