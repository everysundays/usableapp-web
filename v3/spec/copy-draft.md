# Website Copy Draft - Usable App Co.

**Status**: DRAFT - Awaiting review and approval
**Note**: Hero statement pending final selection

---

## Section 1: Hero

### Hero Statement
**"Find good problems. Make good apps."**

### Subheadline (if needed)
We help startups and SMEs discover what their business really needs—before writing a single line of code.

---

## Section 2: What We Do

### Section Headline
**Big Bold Text**: "Start with the right question."
*or*
"Your app already exists. We help you find it."

### Content

We don't just build what you ask for. We discover what your business actually needs.

**Our approach has three steps:**

#### 1. Foundation Discovery
We dig into your business patterns to refine your problem statement. Together, we define your product's goals and expectations—the foundation everything else is built on.

**What you get**: Clear problem definition, validated business goals, project expectations documented

#### 2. Proof of Concept & Research
We plan and conduct research with your real end-users. Through structured interviews and testing, we validate assumptions and uncover requirements you didn't know you had.

**What you get**: User insights from actual interviews, validated requirements, research documentation

#### 3. Deliverables
You receive your first prototype sketch and a comprehensive Business Requirements Specification (BRS)—complete with KPIs. This becomes your roadmap for development.

**What you get**: Initial prototype, firm BRS with documented KPIs, development-ready specifications

### Note on AI
We use Generative AI to draft documents and prototypes—but never for thinking. Every insight, every decision, every strategy comes from human analysis of your unique business.

## Section 3: How It Works

### Section Headline
**Big Bold Text**: "Refine the problem. Define the solution."

### Content

Every product is different. Every business has unique patterns. We don't rush discovery—we do it right.

**The Process:**
- As many proof-of-concepts as needed (typically 5-7 maximum)
- Each PoC validates one assumption, tests one unknown
- Research-driven, user-validated methodology
- Time-based contract ensures thoroughness

**Our Methodology:**
[Product Surface Foundation diagram visualization]

Starting from your business foundation, we layer discovery:
- Problem Statement → What are we really solving?
- Goal & Expectation → What does success look like?
- User Requirements → What do users actually need?
- Workflow → How will this actually work?
- Data Foundation → What information drives decisions?

Each layer builds on validated insights, not assumptions.

**The Work:**
Time-based contract. Typically 5-7 PoCs to reach solid requirements. Duration depends on your product's complexity and discovery needs.

- **Clear but not dumbed-down**: Respect client intelligence while being accessible
- **Witty but not cute**: Smart turns of phrase that clarify, not distract
- **Professional but not corporate**: Approachable consultants, not suit-and-tie bureaucrats
